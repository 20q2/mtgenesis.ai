                           "2) FOCUS ON THE CARD'S IDENTITY: Use the card's name, type, and power level as inspiration. If the card is named 'Sword of Fire', create fire-themed combat abilities. If it's called 'Ancient Tome', focus on knowledge/library effects, not generic card draw. If it's a 'Dragon Engine', combine draconic and mechanical themes. "
                           "3) PRIORITIZE UNIQUE MECHANICS: Instead of generic effects, create interesting abilities like: temporary creature theft, conditional countering, combat phase manipulation, alternate win conditions, unique token creation, innovative triggered conditions, creative activated abilities that aren't just mana generation, spell copying with twists, unique protection effects, interesting sacrifice effects, creative pump effects, unique evasion beyond flying. "
                           "4) MAKE IT MEMORABLE: Every ability should feel distinctive and tied to the card's concept. VARIETY REQUIREMENT: Avoid overused effects like 'draw cards' and 'add mana' - instead prioritize diverse, creative effects that match the card's colors and type. Explore unique mechanics, interesting interactions, and varied effect types. "
                           "COHESION REQUIREMENT: All abilities on a single card must work together thematically and mechanically. Do NOT combine random unrelated abilities. Instead, create cards with unified themes such as: sacrifice synergies (sacrifice creatures ‚Üí get benefits), +1/+1 counter themes (place counters ‚Üí counter-based benefits), graveyard strategies (mill ‚Üí graveyard value), tribal synergies (creature types matter), or mana ramp strategies (produce mana ‚Üí expensive effects). Each ability should support or enhance the others. "
                           "Example of GOOD cohesion: 'When this enters, create two 1/1 tokens' + '{T}, Sacrifice a creature: Draw a card' (token generation supports sacrifice). Example of BAD cohesion: 'Flying' + '{T}: Add mana' + 'Whenever a creature dies, gain 2 life' + 'Discard a card: Deal 1 damage' (random unrelated abilities). "
